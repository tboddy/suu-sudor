Downward spiraling black abyss
When you feel there’s no hope left
Life seems so pointless 

You feel the noose tightening
Cold steel against your head
Uncertainty is a sickness
Is there no end

ch/
  Black clouds mass on the horizon
  Bringing the storm of demise
  The vultures are circling
  The vultures are circling 

Every day is a struggle 
Chemicals to balance you out
Your back against a wall
That’s looking to collapse on you

Self deprecating, self destructive
Chipping away at you daily
You feel your face is in the dirt

ch/

Black doves fly 
A wraith in the shadows 
There’s skeletons in your closet
